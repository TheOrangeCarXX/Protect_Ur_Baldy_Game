About The Game

Inspired by Gun Mayhem 2 (from twoplayergames.org), this game is about two Baldys (Red Baldy and Blue Baldy) fighting over in different worlds with their infi-ammo-pistol-without-recoil-and-timetofire gun that can knock a Baldy back without harming him (Read the story to understand why the bullets are designed to not harm the other Baldy).

Storyline

Two close Baldy friends (Red Baldy and Blue Baldy) who were sailing the universe along with their close friend (You can see him in the guide tab of the game) to find the ultimate treasure called "The Shiny Head". The were sailing on the spaceship of the captain who would later on become the "King Of Baldys"- Shiny D. Roger. Their close friend, Odan was attacked by a strong beast called Kiddo and was killed, the two Baldys blamed each other for their close friend's death, and now are fighting over who would rule their kingdom- Bou. They dont want their kingdom to get destroyed by their fight so they agree to let Blue Baldy rule over the day and Red Baldy to rule over the night, and also agreed to never see each over ever again. But one day they happened to see each other, that is when they pull out their infi-ammo-pistol-without-recoil-and-timetofire gun so that they dont harm their once-close-friend but send him to the underworld.
